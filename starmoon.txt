Sydney practically sparkles with its plied-by-yachts harbor, golden beaches, spectacular headland views, lush parks and gardens, abundance of sunshine, and overall cleanliness. Take a ferry or boat tour to see the unmistakable Sydney Opera House — a symbol of Australia’s oldest and biggest city, and of the continent itself — and Harbour Bridge from the water. Explore the city's wealth of picturesque coastal walks and truly great beaches; beloved Queenscliff Beach has a wide stretch of clean sand, pro-surfer-approved waves, a rock pool, and a lagoon.
